# Introduction to RAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach allows AI systems to provide more accurate and up-to-date information by first searching a knowledge base and then generating responses based on the retrieved context.

## How RAG Works

The RAG process consists of several key steps:

1. **Query Processing**: The user's question is first processed and converted into a format suitable for searching.

2. **Retrieval**: The system searches a knowledge base (often using vector similarity) to find relevant documents or passages.

3. **Context Formation**: Retrieved documents are combined to form a context that will be provided to the language model.

4. **Generation**: The language model generates a response based on both the user's question and the retrieved context.

## Benefits of RAG

RAG offers several advantages over traditional language models:

- More accurate and factual responses
- Ability to access up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucination
- Transparency about sources
